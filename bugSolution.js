The issue was resolved by meticulously handling errors within the Firebase transaction. By checking for error conditions (e.g., `error != null`) after the transaction's completion, I was able to implement proper error logging and prevent silent failures.  Furthermore, the solution involved consistently basing updates on the latest data snapshot obtained within the transaction callback, ensuring that the update operations were atomic and safe from race conditions.  

Example Code (bugSolution.js):

```javascript
firebase.firestore().runTransaction(transaction => {
  return transaction.get(someDocRef).then(doc => {
    if (!doc.exists) {
      throw new Error("Document does not exist!");
    }
    const newData = { ...doc.data(), count: doc.data().count + 1 };
    transaction.update(someDocRef, newData);
    return newData;
  });
}).then(result => {
  console.log("Transaction success:", result);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error("Transaction failure:", error);
});
```
