In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't persisting correctly across sessions, even with offline persistence enabled.  The issue was subtle because data would appear to save, but upon app restart or network change, data would be lost or inconsistent. The problem stemmed from a misuse of Firebase's transaction handling in conjunction with data updates.  Specifically, my transaction function wasn't correctly handling potential errors and was not properly using the snapshot data to perform a conditional update.
